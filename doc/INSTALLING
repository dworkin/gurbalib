There are two ways to do this.  I like using the latest and greatest
version of DGD so I'm giving you the instructions for the "manual"
way of doing things.  

Getting the LATEST version of dgd and installing
---------------------------------------------------------------------
cd to your gurbalib dir and preform the following actions:
	perl scripts/create_data_dirs.pl
		This creates empty directories that are not stored in the
		repository.
	mkdir src
	cd src

	Download the latest driver from: 
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/dgd-osr/files/
	gzip -d dgd-*.tar.gz
		uncompress the tarfile
	tar xvf dgd-*.tar
		extract the tar file.
	cd dgd/src
	make
	make install
	cd ../../..
	cp src/dgd/bin/driver ./bin/
        cp mud.dgd.examp mud.dgd
	edit mud.dgd
		change the directory entry to where you installed things.
		Look it over and change other things if you want.
	cd lib/kernel/include
	cp mudname.h.default mudname.h
	edit the mudname.h file and change the mudname
	cd ../../..
	cp scripts/startmud bin/startmud
	edit bin/startmud and set ROOT
	bin/startmud

	If all went well, you can now connect to the telnet port 
		mentioned in the mud.dgd config file.
		(4000 by default)

The first character logging in will automatically get the
admin role, so be sure its you.

Now jump down to:
OTHER THINGS:

Brief installation instructions using the script
-------------------------------------------------------------
This script is dated so it may or may not work...  If your
not having any luck with the above try this method of getting things
going, or drop me an email.  (my address is in the README file)

CD to your gurbalib dir and type the following:
	perl scripts/create_data_dirs.pl
		This creates empty directories that are not stored in the
		repository.
	scripts/installer	(answer the questions)
  		This will compile the driver, write a configuration
		file and update an include file to reflect the name
		of your mud.

	  Review gurba.dgd and change the telnet port number if so desired.
		You will also need to set the directory

	  bin/startmud

	  If all went well, you can now connect to the telnet port 
		mentioned in the mud.dgd config file.
		(4000 by default)

The first character logging in will automatically get the
admin role, so be sure its you.


OTHER THINGS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You may want to edit the following files as well:
lib/data/messages/login
lib/data/messages/motd

If you want a squeeky clean mud you can also nuke the files in
lib/domains/gurba and lib/domains/newbie  (I would keep them around for
	a little while though since they are at the least example code)

You will want to read the docs that are available and check out
the todo list: lib/TODO
