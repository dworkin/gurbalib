A room in a mud contains the following basics:
	Descriptions, Properties, Exits, Objects, Commands

Descriptions:
You can set the following descriptions in a room:
	short, long, dark_msg, item

Properties:

Exits:

Items:

Commands:


A minimal room object looks like this:
inherit "/std/room";

void setup( void ) {
  add_area( "required" );
  set_short( "The void" );
  set_long( "If you're in here unintentionally, something bugged out. " +
    "Report what you did to the staff." );
  set_exits( ([
               "out" : STARTING_ROOM,
	       "north" : "/domains/required/rooms/void.c"
  ]) );
}

Lets step through this file and then we can talk about other things you can do
as well.

inherit "/std/room";    This line inherits our base class room /std/room.c
This class handles all of our room specific code and makes it easy to create a
simple room, you just create a setup function that changes a couple of things
and you have a working room.

Next we have our setup function.  At a minimum you'll want to call the
4 functions we have shown in our example.  There are other things you
can do as well though.  We'll cover the 4 required functions and then
after that we'll talk about other options.

void add_area(string *area );
	This function basically labels this room as part of the given area.
	That way you can limit wandering monsters to specific areas and
	other nifty tricks.  You could also for example make an object
	that only functions in a given area.

void set_short(string *desc );
	Set the short description of the room.
	Sometimes you can only see the short description of the room so
	you will want to make it descriptive so that users will know where
	they are.

void set_long(string *desc );
	This is a more detailed description of the room.  You'll want to
	make this interesting.

void set_exists( mapping *ex );
	Allows you to create a one to one mapping of directions to rooms.
	You can use additional functions below to add additional exits on
	certain conditions, or to make hidden exits.  The mapping has
	the following format:
	([
		DIRECTION1 : ROOM1,
		DIRECTION2 : ROOM2,
		...
	])
	You in general want to standardize your DIRECTIONS so that the
	mud is consistent, standard directions are:
		north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast,
		southwest, up, down, in, out
	You can use others but its good to update this document and come to
	an agreement on what they will be called.

void set_hidden_exits( mapping *ex );
	Similar to set_exists but these exits will not be shown by a normal
	look.

void add_exit( string direction, string filepath );
	Allows you to add an entry to your existing exits.
	You may have some code where someone creates a new exit to a room
	this function would be used in that case.  Maybe they trigger a
	cave in which opens up a new cavern to the east.

void add_hidden_exit(string direction, string filepath );
	Similar to add_exit but adds a hidden exit.

void remove_exit( string direction );
	Allows you to remove the exit in a given direction.
	The exact opposite of add_exit and can be used in similar situations.

void remove_hidden_exit(string direction );
	Similar to remove_exit but removes a hidden exit.

int query_in_area( string area );
	Tells you if the room is a part of the area you specify.
	It returns 1 if it is, 0 if not.

void set_pk(int flag);
	By default all rooms are player killing safe, this means
	that if a player tries to kill another player it will fail.
        By default pk is 0, /std/combat.c will run
        query_pk() on attack, if it returns a 1 then player killing
	will be allowed.

int query_pk(void);
	This will return the player killing status, right now code
	only exists in combat for 0 - pk safe, or 1 - pk unsafe,
	however query_pk will return any int so other flags such as
	2 could be added to make a room pk safe for newbies but not
	players above x level.
