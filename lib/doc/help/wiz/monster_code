A monster in a mud is kind of a robot player, sometimes called an NPC.
there are various types of "monsters", you can make them passive, aggressive,
you can make them react to players actions or other environmental effects.

Monster's build on the basic object type and add extra features.
A minimal monster object looks like this:
inherit "/std/monster";

void setup(void) {
   set_name("rat");
   add_adj("filthy");
   set_short("A small filthy rat");
   set_long("The rat smells awful.");

   set_gender( "male" );
   set_race("rodent");

   set_level(1);

   set_hit_skill("combat/unarmed");
   set_skill("combat/unarmed", 50);
   set_skill("combat/defense", 100);
}

Here is a description of what is going on in this basic monster:

Just like in our object code, the setup function gets called when an object
is first cloned.

set_name is similar to set_id but for living things.

Monsters have id's, adjectives, a short and a long, just like other objects.

The set_gender function is used to set the gender of a monster.  The following
arguments are acceptable inputs to set_gender: "male", "female", "unknown"

The set_race function looks for a race object in:
	 /domains/required/objects/races
and inherits that file and it's settings.  It's a simple way to setup some
basics about your monster.

Likewise set_level takes a number as input and buffs up the monster to that
basic level, similar to a player when they level up.  It sets the hp, man
and endurance for the monster based on a formula.  You will probably want to
make additional tweaks to each monster but this is a good start.

Skills: Skills are used to increase the chances of success for various tasks.
The following configurations setup some basic skills used by the combat system.
   set_hit_skill("combat/unarmed");  /* Set our default combat skill */
   set_skill("combat/unarmed", 50);  /* Set our proficiency at unarmed combat */
   set_skill("combat/defense", 100); /* Set our proficiency at defense */


Once you have a basic monster, you will probably want to add some equipment and
or treasure to a monster.  Here are some more advanced monsters to look at:

/domains/gurba/monsters/grim.c	A vendor with an inventory of items for sale.
/domains/2.4.5/monsters/troll.c An aggressive monster that mumbles a bit.
/domains/2.4.5/monsters/orc.c A monster that blocks players from going past.
/domains/2.4.5/monsters/wyrm.c A dragon that has treasure and a breath attack.
/domains/2.4.5/monsters/harry.c A monster that interacts with players.

As you can tell from these examples, you should really poke around the
sample domains to find good examples of how to do things.

Once you have written an object you should run check on that object to see
if there are any obvious problems with the object.
